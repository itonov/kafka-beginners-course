* [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".
* [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, share, and run container applications. We handle the tedious setup, so you can focus on the code.
